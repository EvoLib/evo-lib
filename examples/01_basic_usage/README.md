## 01_basic_usage/ â€” Getting Started

This folder provides introductory examples to help you understand the basic usage of EvoLib. These scripts cover:

- Creating individuals and populations
- Mutating individuals
- Evaluating fitness using basic loss functions
- Working with configuration files (`.yaml`)

### Files
- `01_Getting_Started.py`: Minimal working example to run EvoLib with a simple function
- `02_Mutation.py`: Shows how to apply mutation manually
- `03_Population_Mutation.py`: Applies mutation across an entire population
- `04_Fitness.py`: Demonstrates evaluation of individuals using a fitness function

### Notes
- These examples **do not use plotting**
- They are designed for clarity and minimal dependencies
- Configuration is loaded from `population.yaml` in this folder
